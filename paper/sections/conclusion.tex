\section{Conclusion}


We presented \systemName, a system for adding realistic geometric and texture details on large-scale coarse building mass models guided by example images for style. Our system is based on a cascaded set of GANs that are individually controlled by generator vectors for style synchronization. We evaluated our system on a range of large-scale urban mass models and qualitatively evaluated the quality of the detailed models via a set of user studies. 


The most direct way to improve the quality of output generated by \systemName is to retrain the GANs using richer and more accurately annotated facade and roof datasets and also to extend the system to generate street textures and furniture, as well as trees and botanical elements. This is a natural improvement as many research efforts are now focused on capturing high quality facade data with improved quality annotations. 
%
A more non-trivial extension is to explore a GAN-based approach that directly generates textured 3D geometry. 
The challenge here is to find a way to compare rendered procedural models with images based on photographs that also includes facade structure rather than just texture details.
%
Finally, it would be interesting to combine our proposed approach to author both realistic building mass models along with their detailing directly from rough input from the user in the form of sketches~\cite{Nishida:2016:ISU:2897824.2925951} or high-level functional specifications~\cite{Peng:2016:CND}.
